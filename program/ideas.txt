Step 1: Get internal scan information
command line stuff:
aws ec2 describe-instances
aws ec2 describe-security-groups (get from instance info)
aws iam get-role-policy (get from instance info)
aws iam get-role (get from instance info)

using this info look at open ports, vpcs, subnets, and so on.
things to note here (both for report and for program)
* open ports
* ingress/egress rules
* ips
* security group names
* open ports and their services
* general weaknesses

using this data, procceed to step 2: attempt attack.
* somehow gather network data (responses to queries)
* test open ports
* do portscans
* attempt brute force methods with common logins and passwords
* scan for all useful info
* if access gained through this method, record that for step 3.

step 3: internal compromise simulaion
First the program actually gains access to a box using a provided password
It then will attempt role escilation as well as seeing what information is
possible to find.
* what data can be gathered from inside the box?
* can it escillate its own privilages?
* does your log catch any unusual activity?
* can it lower firewall rules?
* can it attempt to breach into other boxes with brute force?
* can it send important files to another remote computer without being noticed or stopped?
* can it disable logs?
* what privilages will it have?
* etc

step 3.1: iam role escillation
If a hacker managed to get into a (or your) account, what could they
find/do in the system + would it be noticed?
* privilage escillation
* what can be discovered
* can boxes be destroyed?
* aws keys
* secret files
* iam role editing/viewing
* what can be made, editied, or viewed?

step 4: report
all data and vulnerabilities uncovered should be recorded in a readable and
concise document with time stamps, speciifc actions taken, and summaries.
